        <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> The Beginning: Understanding Systems</h2>
        <p>While my path to software engineering hasn't been easy, it has influenced the way I currently think, work, and solve issues. The majority of my decisions so far have been influenced by my lifelong passion for how systems—whether they be settings, data, or technology—operate.</p>
        <p>My first field of study was <strong>geography</strong>, which at first glance might not seem to have anything to do with software development. But it also taught me how to identify patterns, examine complicated systems, and comprehend cause and effect on a large scale. I developed a strong interest in how data influences decision-making, particularly when those decisions have an impact on society and the environment. I became more interested in technology as a result of this curiosity, realising that I could combine practical problem-solving with analytical thinking.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Master's in Sustainability</h2>
        <p>I decided to pursue a <strong>master's degree in sustainability</strong> because of my curiosity. I worked a lot with data, reporting, and analytical frameworks during my postgraduate studies, focussing on long-term decision-making, systems thinking, and environmental performance. What stood out to me was how often good decisions were limited not by intent, but by poor tools, unreliable data, or inefficient processes.</p>
        <p class="problem-impact"><strong>That realisation is what pushed me towards technology.</strong></p>

        <h2><i class="fab fa-python"></i> The COVID-19 Turning Point</h2>
        <p>I started learning <strong>Python</strong> on my own during the COVID-19 lock down because I was curious and wanted to build instead than simply analyse. This was before I officially enrolled in a Software Engineering degree program.</p>

          <h3>My First Python Project</h3>
          <p>One of the first small applications I created was a simple program that randomly selected movies based on my mood, pulling from different genres and preferences. While modest, it marked a turning point in my journey. The satisfaction of building something functional and helpful was genuinely exciting — and it made me realise this was the kind of work I wanted to keep doing.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>I immediately realised that I wanted to develop the tools that supported systems rather than simply study them.</strong></p>

      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Bachelor's in Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>I went on to complete a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering</strong>, where I truly fell in love with developing software. Coding became more than syntax; it was about transforming ideas into useful, real-world solutions. I enjoyed debugging, improving performance, and designing systems that make sense for people, not just machines.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-code"></i> Learning Through Building</h2>
        <p>A key part of my growth has come from learning through building. My main personal project is a <strong>Residential Management System</strong>, documented as a public case study on my portfolio:</p>

          <h3>Residential Management System</h3>
          <p>The system is designed to improve communication, record-keeping, and operational clarity in residential management. While the full source code remains private to protect the work, the case study openly covers the architecture, tech stack, workflows, design decisions, and the challenges I faced along the way.</p>
